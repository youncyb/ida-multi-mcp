# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Last updated: 2026-09-12
Status: Active
Change class: B (scope/architecture)

## 1. Product Goal
`ida-multi-mcp` provides an analysis environment that safely routes to multiple IDA instances through a single MCP endpoint.

## 2. Core Requirements
- Explicit per-instance routing: every IDA tool call requires `instance_id`.
- Multi-instance operation: supports concurrent analysis of multiple binaries.
- Tool surface stability: maintains tool visibility via static + dynamic schema federation.
- Install/operational practicality: supports cross-platform plugin installation and MCP client configuration automation.
- Optional Streamable HTTP transport so a remote MCP client (e.g. OpenCode `type: remote`) can reach a VM-local aggregator without reading the host registry.

## 3. In Scope
- Registry-based instance lifecycle management
- Router-based `instance_id` enforced dispatch
- Cache/paged retrieval of large responses
- IDA plugin auto-load/auto-register

## 4. Out of Scope
- External public HTTP API platform
- DB-backed persistent storage
- On-call operational services (services requiring a runbook)

## 5. Project Profile
